										.content
											p It is very welcoming and friendly, which lifts the mood and the series of houses of wonderful architecture seems even more beautiful and leaves just a fabulous impression of Amsterdam. Ron and Nel in the form of a cheerful dialogue told interesting stories about Amsterdam and its inhabitants. Loved the tour and attractive priceâ€¦
